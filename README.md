 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a React.js application using a RESTful API.
It focuses on how to connect the frontend to a backend API for data manipulation and display, using modern React hooks and components.

 Features

Create – Add new records using a form.

Read – Fetch and display data from an API.

Update – Edit existing records with live updates.

Delete – Remove records permanently from the database.

API Integration – Communicates with an external REST API using fetch() or axios.

State Management – Utilizes useState and useEffect hooks.

Reusable Components – Designed with modular and maintainable React components.

 Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js (with Hooks)

HTTP Client: Axios / Fetch API

Styling: CSS or Tailwind (optional)

Backend (API): JSON Server / Node.js / Any RESTful API

Package Manager: npm or yarn
